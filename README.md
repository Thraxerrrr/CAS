# CAS
## Customizable Attachment System
*A mod for Conan Exiles that adds a new, customizable inventory.*

### What is CAS?
This mod adds a new inventory panel to your character, allowing you to equip much more than the 5 standard armor slots.
There are two types of items that can be equipped:

- **Cosmetic items**: sheathed weapons, jewellery, masks, smoking pipes, etc.
- **Functional items**: wearables that offer a buff or boost to your character.

### Which items can I equip?

First of all, you can equip any combination of weapons and/or shields on an appropriate location: either on your belt, or on your back.

Second, there is a **belt** system which allows you to craft and equip belts. The better the quality of the belt, the more **pouch** slots it will unlock. In these pouch slots, you can equip... pouches! Pouches are functional attachments: each equipped pouch will give your character a specific buff.

CAS also offers several cosmetic items that you can equip in the Misc slots. More cosmetics will be added with future updates!

### Where are these items? How can I craft them?

In order to craft the CAS items, you need to learn the feats first:

- **Belt Crafter**: unlocks the crafting of belts and pouches
- **Wearable Accessory Crafter**: unlocks the crafting of cosmetic items

Once you have learned these feats, you can craft the items in various crafting stations:

- **Belts and Pouches**: can be crafted at the *Armorer's Bench*. The high-tier belt can be crafted at the *Improved Armorer's Bench*.
- **Cosmetics**: can be crafted at the *Artisan Table*.

### For Admins and Modders
