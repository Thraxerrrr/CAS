# CAS
## Customizable Attachment System
*A mod for Conan Exiles that adds a new, customizable inventory.*

### What is this mod?
This mod adds a new 'inventory panel' to your character, allowing you to equip much more than the 5 standard armor slots.
There are two types of items that can be equipped:

- **Cosmetic items**: sheathed weapons, jewellery, masks, smoking pipes, etc.
- **Functional items**: wearables that offer a buff or boost to your character.
